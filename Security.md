# Valigator Staking Security
We put huge priority on security and ethical operations. We apply all best practices from our experience running enterprise technology environments to our operations in blockchain infrastructure. We run our systems like our own tokens depend on it. Because they do.

## Security
Valigator uses all common security features and software, including but not limited to, timely software updates, ssh keys for connections (no passwords), multi factor authentication, closed ports to the public, virtual private networks, etc. We also follow best practices such as least privaledge access (only those that need access, have access and only to what they need).

## Solana software
We do not apply any modifications to the open source validator software clients, other than the Jito software.

## Validator commission
On the public validator we run at 4% commission on inflation and 4% on MEV. See details and sign up for alerts here: https://stakewiz.com/validator/gaToR246dheK1DGAMEqxMdBJZwU4qFyt7DzhSwAHFWF

## Why git and not a webpage?
